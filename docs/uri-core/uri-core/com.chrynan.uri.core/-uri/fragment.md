# fragment

[common]\
abstract val [fragment](fragment.md): [String](https://kotlinlang.org/api/core/kotlin-stdlib/kotlin/-string/index.html)?

A [Uri](index.md) Fragment component is the portion of the URI after the [query](query.md) component. It is an optional component that is preceded by a hash ('#') character. A Fragment contains a fragment identifier which links to a secondary resource, such as a section header in an article. When the primary source is an HTML document, typically the Fragment is an HTML identifier (id) value of a specific HTML element.

This property will return this Fragment component of the [Uri](index.md) without the preceding hash ('#') character.
